A Curses based, Tree style, Path Picker/file browser/dialog.

-   Pre-order file system traversal from a given point, or `$PWD` if not specified,
    using Vi or Emacs bindings (or the arrow keys).
-   Expand or collapse child nodes one at a time or all at once.
-   Recursively get disk usage of a single node or all expanded nodes.
-   Toggle marking of files that can then be piped into another program or simply
    echoed back to the screen upon exit.
