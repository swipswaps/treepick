* CURSES PATH PICKER

A curses based path picker/file browser.

- Pre-order file system traversal from a given point, or $PWD if not specified,
  using Vi or Emacs bindings (or the arrow keys).
- Expand or collapse child nodes one at a time or all at once.
- Recursively get disk usage of a single node or all expanded nodes.
- Toggle marking of files that can then be piped into another program or simply
  echoed back to the screen upon exit.
